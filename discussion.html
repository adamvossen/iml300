    <p class="body"> This page is dedicated to displaying my IML 300 class projects. Enjoy! </p>

  <div>
      <h1 class="heading">Week One</h1>
      <p class="body">
1. As an artist, is the increased visibility on platforms like Instagram worth the loss of creative freedom?
<br>
2. How can we change algorithms to reduce echo chambers and bring in diverse thought without a completely randomized space? 
<br>
3. Have we gotten too used to algorithms “reading our minds” that nothing less (such as randomized content) is worth our time anymore?
</p>
  </div>

  <div>
      <h1 class="heading">Week Two</h1>
      <p class="body">
1. Does everything on a screen need to have a metaphor to real life? Can you think of something that doesn’t?
<br>
2. Why did we stop wanting to reflect the physical world as accurately as possible on our screens?
<br>
3. What are the dangers in making user-experience on screens as humanistic-like as possible?
</p>
  </div>
    
<br>
  <div>
      <h1 class="heading">Week Five</h1>
      <p class="body">
1. Why do we want surveillance in the form of social media validation?
<br>
2. Why are we so interested with the difference on how we see ourselves and how the world sees us?
<br>
3. Can we avoid the monetization of our surveillance of even our DNA?
</p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h1 class="heading">Week Six</h1>
      <p class="body">
1. Are tech companies benefiting from our ignorance? We don’t know what things like nodes and servers are, and we place all of our trust into this never-failing cloud that can permanently store our data.
<br>
2. Is speed more important than direction in the tech/internet industries? Why and how can this be toxic?
<br>
3. How can we categorize the internet to make a hierarchy on what is important so things don’t get lost in a bottomless pit? Trusted organizations have verification badges on social media, is this all we need?
</p>
  </div>
      <div>
      <h1 class="heading">Week Seven</h1>
      <p class="body">
1. What are creative ways to implement activist messages in ways that won’t get picked up by algorithms? Will this creativity also help with “compassion fatigue” by challenging traditional activism on social media that we are overloaded with?
<br>
2. What makes a meme go from activism to offensive?
<br>
3. Have you seen a relation between poor images, imperfection and memes? (ex: android comedy, “deep-fried" filters) What does that represent?
</p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h1 class="heading">Week Eight</h1>
      <p class="body">
1. Are companies aware of their algorithmic biases and discriminatory practices, but continuing to use them to benefit the majority and “keep the privileged more privileged”?
<br>
2. How can we make data collection require consent? Are the Terms & Conditions purposely long and in pedantic language so people overlook them?
<br>
3. A completely unbiased algorithm/platform doesn’t exist, so what should we be aiming for? Is using the word “bias” a bit too broad and misguided?
</p>
  </div>
 <div>
      <h1 class="heading">Week Ten</h1>
      <p class="body">
1. Is the collective decline of mental health in our generation due to data trauma?
<br>
2. How can we prioritize love over likes?
<br>
3. The single story also applies to social media. Are we posting the “single story” of ourselves on social media that we are eventually becoming it and being judged by it? How can this be harmful?
