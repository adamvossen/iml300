### Other Chrome extension concepts I am interested in creating
1. "CAPS LOCK STRESS RELEASE"
When you are doing homework, writing an essay or working on a project and you feel stuck and stressed, this extension will give you a box with optional prompts for you to vent and release your stress and anger in all caps.
2. "Moodboard Maker"
When you visit a website that is aesthetically pleasing, this extension will extract the main colors, visuals, patterns, fonts, images etc into one moodboard for you to reference.
3. "Chill Slowmo"
For when the internet feels too fast-paced, this extension will slow the frame rates down on your browser, but will blend them and add chroma effects to give a relaxing, psychedelic vibe.
4. "Breathe"
This extension will randomly send you an alert to stop what you're doing and focus on your breath for 30 minutes.
5. "Affirmations
This extension will give you daily affirmations every time you open your browser to help you be more mindful and positive.
